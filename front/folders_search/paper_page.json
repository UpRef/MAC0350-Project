  "abstract":"  The vortex contribution to the dc field (H) dependent microwave surface\nimpedance Z_s = R_s+iX_s of YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-x} thin films was measured using\nsuspended patterned resonators. Z_s(H) is shown to be a direct measure of the\nflux density B(H) enabling a very precise test of models of flux penetration.\nThree regimes of field-dependent behavior were observed: (1) Initial flux\npenetration occurs on very low field scales H_i(4.2K) 100Oe, (2) At moderate\nfields the flux penetration into the virgin state is in excellent agreement\nwith calculations based upon the field-induced Bean critical state for thin\nfilm geometry, parametrized by a field scale H_s(4.2K) J_c*d 0.5T, (3) for very\nhigh fields H >>H_s, the flux density is uniform and the measurements enable\ndirect determination of vortex parameters such as pinning force constants\n\\alpha_p and vortex viscosity \\eta. However hysteresis loops are in\ndisagreement with the thin film Bean model, and instead are governed by the low\nfield scale H_i, rather than by H_s. Geometric barriers are insufficient to\naccount for the observed results.\n"
