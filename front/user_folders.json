Productions of its neutral and doubly charged\npartners are also studied. As the result, it is concluded that they could be\nobserved in B decays. Their iso-singlet partner might have been observed in the\nradiative channels of B decays by the BELLE Collaboration.\n"

In addition we correct the formula for the redshift of sound\nsignals from our original work. We show that, if there exists a special kind of\nBorn-Infeld type scalar field, then one can send information from inside a\nblack hole. This information is encoded in perturbations of the field\npropagating in non-trivial scalar field backgrounds, which serve as a \"new\nether\". Although the action of the theory is manifestly Lorentz-invariant the\nnon-trivial solutions break this symmetry spontaneously, allowing, the\nsuperluminal propagation of perturbations with respect to this \"new ether\". We\nfound the stationary solution for background, which describes the accretion of\nthe scalar field onto a black hole. Examining the propagation of small\nperturbations around this solution we show that the signals emitted inside the\nSchwarzschild horizon can reach an observer located outside the black hole.\nThus the accreting field forms a hydrodynamical analog of a black hole whose\nhorizon is inside of the gravitational black hole drawing in the scalar field.\n"

The microwave loss was initially found to decrease for\nsmall applied DC field before increasing again. Also, non-linearities inherent\nin the sample were found to be substantially suppressed at low powers at these\napplied fields. These two features together can lead to significant improvement\nin device performance.\n"

Z_s(H) is shown to be a direct measure of the\nflux density B(H) enabling a very precise test of models of flux penetration.\nThree regimes of field-dependent behavior were observed: (1) Initial flux\npenetration occurs on very low field scales H_i(4.2K) 100Oe, (2) At moderate\nfields the flux penetration into the virgin state is in excellent agreement\nwith calculations based upon the field-induced Bean critical state for thin\nfilm geometry, parametrized by a field scale H_s(4.2K) J_c*d 0.5T, (3) for very\nhigh fields H >>H_s, the flux density is uniform and the measurements enable\ndirect determination of vortex parameters such as pinning force constants\n\\alpha_p and vortex viscosity \\eta. However hysteresis loops are in\ndisagreement with the thin film Bean model, and instead are governed by the low\nfield scale H_i, rather than by H_s. Geometric barriers are insufficient to\naccount for the observed results.\n"
