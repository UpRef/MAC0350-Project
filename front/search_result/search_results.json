        "abstract": "The interlayer pair tunneling model of Anderson et al. is generalized to include the strong coupling effects associated with in-plane interactions. The equations for the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} are solved numerically for several models of electron-optical phonon coupling. The nonmagnetic in-plane impurity scattering suppresses T_{c} in all cases considered, and it is possible to obtain a fair agreement with experiments for a reasonable choice of parameters. For the anisotropic electron-phonon coupling proposed by Song and Annett we find that the interlayer pair tunneling can stabilize the d_{x^2-y^2}-wave superconducting state with a high T_{c}. Moreover, in this case there is a possibility of an impurity induced crossover from the d$_{x^2-y^2}$-wave state stabilized by the interlayer tunneling to the s-wave state at a low impurity concentration. We also calculate the isotope effect associated with the in-plane oxygen optic mode and its dependence on the strength of the interlayer pair tunneling. Small positive values of the isotope exponent are obtained for strengths of pair tunneling that give high transition temperatures."

        "abstract": "We study the effect of fluctuations on the {\\bf ac} conductivity of a layered superconductor both for $c$-axis and $ab$-plane electromagnetic wave polarizations. The fluctuation contributions of different physical nature and signs (paraconductivity, Maki-Thompson anomalous contribution, one-electron density of states renormalization) are found to be suppressed by the external field at different characteristic frequencies ($ \\omega_{\\rm AL}\\sim T-T_{\\rm c}$, $\\omega_{\\rm MT} \\sim \\max\\{ T-T_{\\rm c}, \\tau_{\\varphi}^{-1}\\}$, $\\omega_{\\rm DOS} \\sim \\min\\{T,\\tau ^{-1}\\}$ for the $2D$ case). As a result the appearance of the nonmonotonic frequency dependence (pseudogap) in the infrared optical conductivity of HTS film is predicted. The effect has to be especially pronounced in the case of the electromagnetic field polarization along $c$-axis."

From the functional form of $T_{irr}(\\theta)$ we conclude that the origin of the irreversibility line in unirradiated films is a dynamic crossover from an unpinned to a pinned vortex liquid. In irradiated films the irreversibility temperature is determined by the trapping angle."

Their iso-singlet partner might have been observed in the radiative channels of B decays by the BELLE Collaboration."
